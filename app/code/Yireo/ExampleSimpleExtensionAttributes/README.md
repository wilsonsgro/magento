# Example Simple Extension Attributes
An example of how to create Extension Attributes. The file `extension_attributes.xml` lists some new attributes that are added as plain text values. Next, a Plugin is used to add the attributes to the repository input and output. Values are stored in a separate table (see the Setup class). There is a CLI command as a proof of concept.

### Installation
